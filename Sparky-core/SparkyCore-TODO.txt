 Sparky Core - TODO
--------------------

- Complete event system with additional events (focus, close, resize, etc.)
- Custom Allocators / Memory management (in-progress)
- Really need string formatting!
- DirectX for Windows
- Bring back GLFW for OpenGL (at least on Mac/Linux)
- Font metrics
- Eliminate hard coded projection matrices for 2D layers
- SP_DEBUG macros
- mat3 support
- Better logging. Seriously.
- Check for memory leaks. Likely.
- Some kind of Asset Server. This needs to support things like memory mapping and virtual file systems.
- Raw Input instead of Win32 stuff
